</p>

This theme is based on Vite.

# Quick start

git clone git@github.com:marvinruder/keycloakify-mruder.dev.git
cd keycloakify-starter
yarn install # Or use an other package manager, just be sure to delete the yarn.lock if you do.
```

# How to customize the theme

# Building the theme

You need to have Maven installed to build the theme (The `mvn` command must be in the PATH).

-   On macOS: `brew install maven`
-   On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install maven`
-   On Windows: `choco install openjdk` and `choco install maven` (Or download from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi))

```bash
npm run build-keycloak-theme
```

Note that by default Keycloakify generates multiple .jar files for different versions of Keycloak.  
You can customize this behavior, see documentation [here](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/v/v10/targetting-specific-keycloak-versions).

# GitHub Actions

The theme comes with a generic GitHub Actions workflow that builds the theme and publishes
the jars [as GitHub releases artifacts](https://github.com/marvinruder/keycloakify-mruder.dev/releases/).  
To release a new version **just update the `package.json` version and push**.

To enable the workflow go to your fork of this repository on GitHub then navigate to:
`Settings` > `Actions` > `Workflow permissions`, select `Read and write permissions`.
